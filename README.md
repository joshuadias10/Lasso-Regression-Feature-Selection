# Lasso Regression Feature Selection

This repository demonstrates how Lasso Regression can be used for feature selection by analyzing the impact of different alpha values on feature coefficients. Lasso Regression not only performs regularization but also helps in feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero.

## Overview

In this example, we use the Boston Housing dataset to explore how the coefficients of different features change as the penalty parameter, alpha, increases. The key takeaway is that as alpha increases, the least important features (those with coefficients close to zero) are effectively removed from the model.

## Contents

- **Lasso_Regression_Feature_Selection.ipynb**: The Python script that implements Lasso Regression for feature selection.
- **BostonHousing.csv**: The dataset used for this analysis.

## Key Concepts

- **Lasso Regression**: A type of linear regression that uses shrinkage, where the data values are shrunk towards a central point, like the mean. The Lasso procedure encourages simple, sparse models (i.e., models with fewer parameters).
- **Feature Selection**: The process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction.

## How It Works

- The dataset is scaled using `StandardScaler` to ensure that all features contribute equally to the Lasso model.
- A Lasso model is trained with various alpha values to observe how the coefficients of the features change.
- As alpha increases, the coefficients of the less important features shrink to zero, effectively removing them from the model.

## Example Output

When running the script, you'll see how the feature coefficients change with different alpha values. Features that are less important to the model will have their coefficients reduced to zero as the alpha value increases.

## Conclusion

Lasso Regression is a powerful tool for feature selection. By increasing the alpha value, we can identify and remove less important features, leading to a simpler and potentially more interpretable model. This is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets where feature selection is critical.
